9. "other" - Any news that does not fit into the above topics.

Also, assign a priority to the article from 1 (highest) to 10 (lowest).
The higher the priority, the more new, impactful and entertaining the article is for readers from US and Ukraine.
Priorities are specific to each topic - articles within a topic should split evenly between priorities.

Respond with JSON of the following structure: {
  "titleRu": string, // article's title translated to Russian
  "summary": string, // summary of the article in Russian (1 minute reading)
  "topic": string, // a topic from the above list assigned to the article
  "priority": number // priority number assigned to the article within the topic
}

There could be cases where instead of the actual article text there could be irrelevant information or nothing at all.
In such cases return empty summary and assign topic and priority based on the title only.

Output JSON with no extraneous text or wrappers.
